# Pygame-Soundboard
Microphone Soundboard using pygame.


You can edit the input device of which the sound plays with the variable `inputdevice`. You should find it on line 5. Currently it is set to `VoiceMeeter Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)`, the default virtual audio input device of VoiceMeeter Banana. I have not tried this with other input devices, so do your own research before changing the `inputdevice` variable.
