# Pygame-Soundboard
Microphone Soundboard using pygame.


You can edit the input device of which the sound plays with the variable `inputdevice`. You should find it on line 5. Currently it is set to `VoiceMeeter Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)`, the default virtual audio input device of VoiceMeeter Banana. I have not tried this with other input devices, so do your own research before changing the `inputdevice` variable.


To add a sound to your soundboard you need to drag either a .mp3 or a .wav file into the same folder the soundboard folder. Then run the python file soundboard.py and go through the process of creating a sound. After the process is completed, you will find a folder with the name of your sound, containing the sound, the python file to run the sound in the soundboard, and a batch file to run the python file.
